        We are user centric and have designed precise user processes 
        on Figma, from the game to various functional pages, ensuring 
        that users can easily understand and navigate the game. On the 
        basis of the original game, we have introduced extended mode, 
        which allows players to switch game modes at any time through 
        the switch button. This provides players with more options, 
        allowing them to adjust the gaming experience according to 
        their interests and needs.</div>

        My main contribution lies in designing three game systems 
        that combine game mechanisms to help elderly people achieve 
        healthier lifestyle habits in our expanded version. At the 
        same time, our design will also be more tailored to the usage 
        habits and cognition of elderly users, actively optimizing 
        this model from their perspective.</div>

    Players will receive a specific health goal every month, 
    such as walking distance, exercise time, or dietary planning. 
    Completing tasks will earn rewards that can be used in the game, 
    increasing the correlation between the game and health. 
    In addition, tasks can also motivate players to actively 
    participate in daily exercise and health management.</div>

        By launching a daily step count system, real-life 
        walking can be transformed into virtual revenue 
        within the game. Players can accumulate steps through movement, 
        which will be converted into virtual currency or props within the game. 
        This not only encourages players' daily exercise, but also increases 
        the playability of the game.</div>

        In order to pay attention to the needs of elderly 
        players, we have designed an automatic pathfinding 
        home system. When players feel tired or inconvenient, 
        they can activate the home system, and the game will 
        automatically plan the shortest home route for them. </div>

        In addition to the health system, we also focused 
        on the mental health and interpersonal relationships
         of elderly players. We will introduce social functions 
         in the game, allowing players to team up, communicate, 
         and collaborate with other players, enhancing social 
         interaction. In addition, we regularly organize online 
         and offline social activities to provide players with a 
         platform to make new friends and share gaming experiences. 
         The cultivation of such interpersonal relationships is 
         crucial for the mental health of elderly players and also
          makes games a bridge for social interaction. However, due 
          to time and energy constraints, we did not actually design 
          this part of the content. We hope to have the opportunity 
          to supplement our development experience in this area in 
          the future.</div>
