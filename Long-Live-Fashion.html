      The navigation bar is the core of a website, featuring four 
      prominent color blocks: red, yellow, green, and blue, closely linked 
      to the theme of the "Long Live Fashion" event. Each color block 
      represents different content, providing users with a concise and 
      clear navigation method, allowing them to easily find the content 
      they are interested in.</div>

  <div class="llf-artwork-text-left">
    What we are particularly proud of is the yellow page we designed, which is a place to showcase art 
    works. Here, the audience will discover a series of exquisite fashion artworks, and we have prepared 
    a detailed introduction for each one. My main contribution is to use different Java scripts to achieve 
    a combination of mouse animation and page animation.</div>

    In order to facilitate customers' participation in the "Long Live Fashion" event, 
    we have designed a green ticketing page. Here, you can choose the appropriate date

    In order to enhance the user experience, we have added some interactive 
    animation effects to the website. We achieved a smooth switching effect 
    between pages using HTML and JavaScript. By triggering different events, 
    such as clicking on different color blocks in the navigation bar, we can provide 
    users with a seamless page transition effect, making the entire browsing process 
    smoother and more enjoyable. At the same time, on the artwork page, we have also 
    added hover effects to each piece, allowing users to better understand the details 
    of the artwork.</div>

    In summary, our customized "Long Live Fashion" website for textielmuseum 
    is a perfect fusion of design, interaction, and user experience. From the 
    colors of the navigation bar to the animation effects of the page, every element 
    has been carefully designed to allow users to deeply understand the charm of fashion, 
    participate in activities, and leave beautiful memories. Our code implements smooth 
    animation for page switching, providing users with a smooth browsing experience.</div>
